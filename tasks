- [ ] fix the rewards
    rewards(pool_id) -> (claimed, earnings)


interface:

- connect contracts for env
- dash:
    feature a set few pools
- pool:
    load:
        isMember
        pool details
        
        listen:
            members events
            torrent events
        
        poll:
            your total upload
            unclaimed rewards
            
            realtime download rate
        
        aggregator:
            serve endpoint for each pool:
                (t, downloaded)
            load download rates from aggregator
        
        interactions:
            join pool
            leave pool
            claim tokens


what's the simplest thing I can do today?

- package the node software for npm + publish
- deploy contracts to anvil
- run+build aggregator
- run node software
- create a pool using Init.s.sol
- view it in the dapp
- join the pool in the dapp
- watch as node autojoins and seeds torrent
- start a downloader
- watch as reports flow into aggregator
- check dapp
- (rewards, download) should refresh in realtime.

then for demo:
- issue the axon token
- user flow:
    install the axon-miner
    join the "stupid dummy dataset" pool
    watch as other people download the dataset
        view a video
    earn tokens!
    use those tokens to create your own pool
        upload a file to arweave
        then create an onchain pool
        watch as nodes spin up to host the file


what does this entail?
- aggregator
    serve endpoint for realtime upload/downloads
    serve endpoint for "total uploaded"
- dapp
    integrate wagmi
    load pool data from on-chain
        name
        symbol
    [x] build "join/leave" button
    build "get rewards"
        req from aggregator
    build "get your upload"
        req from aggregator
    build "realtime view downloads"
        req from aggregator
    build "is node live" indicator
        req from node
- token
    issue axon token
    setup pool so that people can earn axon for hosting





- integration
    run node with key









other stuff:
- create pool
    upload files
    add tokens
- pool
    edit details
    propose new files
    buy/sell tokens to propose new files??
        issue AXON token to hosters
        nodes earn it for hosting data
        users can buy and stake it in order to get rewards
        users can buy and pay it in order to get data hosted


    zk gate tokens in pool



- earnings

- node
    show if node is online / responding to heartbeat
