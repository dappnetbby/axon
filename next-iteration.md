npm i -g dappnet-protocol
PRIVATE_KEY=123123123123 dappnet-protocol node
    starts the webtorrent
    get list of pools we're in
        gets each torrent and starts downloading it
    sends data to aggregator

dapp:
    total earnings
    torrent is public
    
    torrentship
    
    membership of pool is private:
        ZK stake DAI to get a file widely shared
        the aggregator determines the payouts
        then nodes can zk claim their payout

        you can also just run your node
        stake it in whatever things you want to get data widely shared
        "SEED" / "STOP SEEDING"

        you start earning tokens for doing so:
        - earn AXON tokens for participation
        

        what would be a funny pool mechanic?
        each file is an NFT
        you can buy/sell the NFT at any time, it's like unisocks
        

        hamsters think hamsters
        you buy the hamster token, then you earn fees from gambling
        if you earn fees, then you invest them into gambling
        win win


        risk hierarchy:
        -> sharing files 
        -> buying NFT's

        
        just you earn tokens 
        it's funnyyou create a pool
        put some funny files in there
        other people join your pool by contributing their file sharing initially
        that's the speculative bittorrentthey earn the token for contributing file sharing
        and if the pool ends up being popular, something will be worth a lot of money
        what will it be? idk
        but maybe the files are NFT's
        "bro I got $MEME_MAGIC_FOLDER_SUNRISE" yesterday, such a good file
        and the community is so funny
        it's like a dead drop
        yeah something like thatmaybe you just earn tokens for sharing silly files
        and then people who wanna be in can buy the token


        okay so 3 ideas:
        1. you get tokens for hosting files. 
        2. those tokens are memes like "$DUMB_MEMES_FOLDER" by abra
        3. you can vote on the stuff if you host / buy them, there is also a chat
        4. if ppl want, they can mint the file to show on farcaster
            burn the tokens to mint the NFT, thus showing you're early.
            one nft = one access pass.
        
        you can also burn the NFT to get $AXON



        it's like a uniswap pool
        where one side is the token
        $RATS_ASS
        and the other side are the NFT's (files)


        the way it's private
        is that you earn the tokens privately
        but no-one knows what you're hosting
        so you can sell your tokens back into axon
        which is public
