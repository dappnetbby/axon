The Axon idea of tokenomics is slightly different to Filecoin, Arweave, Crust Network.

This is a latent idea, but it seems like blockchains are most used when they enable speculative fiction. 

When it comes to file-sharing, this means - "oh wow, if I contribute my resources, maybe I'll make a lot of money".

Axon's design is more like a framework for data sharing communities, rather than a single data-sharing community.

For example, you could start a pool for dapps. Different dapps can apply to be part of this pool.

Or you could start a pool for Machine Learning datasets. Different people can host these datasets in this pool.

Each pool can design their own token rewards mechanism - for example, you might "boost" users who seed your dapp, if they hold your native token. Or you might reward users with an NFT if they seed an important dataset. 

The Axon protocol only takes a small % fee for operating the aggregator network, and uses a token to perform sybil control.

I think this probably matches reality better. Arweave/Filecoin are based on one network which hosts everything. You don't really see "waves of people" coming through and contributing resources. And you don't really see "Filecoin" or "Arweave" forks either. This is not to say their approach is bad - it's just noticeably different. We've seen forks of bitcoin, forks of ethereum, why not a fork of arweave? I don't know.

Axon's idea is to be forked. Or more accurately, enable this "forking" aka experimentation within the protocol itself. And the most malleable layer to experiment with is economics. So let's enable that.
